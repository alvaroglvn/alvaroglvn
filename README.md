## Hey, I'm Alvaro 👋

I'm a self-taught AI and backend engineer—and former founder—with a background in design and storytelling. I combine these skills (plus a lifelong love of genre fiction) to create imaginative, human-centric tools powered by LLMs and AI diffusion models. My goal is to craft thoughtful, technically solid applications that push the boundary between creativity and code.
