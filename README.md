## Hey, I'm Alvaro 👋

I'm a self-taught AI and backend engineer—and former founder—with a background in design and storytelling. I combine these skills (plus a lifelong love of genre fiction) to create imaginative, human-centric tools powered by LLMs and AI diffusion models. My goal is to craft thoughtful, technically solid applications that push the boundary between creativity and code.

### 🛠️ Recent Projects  
Both are live—feel free to check them out!

#### 🏛️ The Ravensfield Collection  
A fully-automated AI museum that generates weird, lore-rich artwork and stories from scratch — using a multi-step Claude + Leonardo.AI pipeline with parallel generation, schema validation, and a vision consistency pass to make sure the image and the text actually agree.

#### 👽 Astroulette  
A real-time chat app where users interact with AI-generated characters from across the galaxy — with a Python/FastAPI backend, SQLite3, and a responsive SvelteKit 2/Svelte 5 frontend.
